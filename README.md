GUI for Lakeshore 330/336/340 temperature monitoring and setting of setpoint temperature

Class is based on the file by Richard Ziegahn: https://github.com/RickyZiegahn/Lakeshore-Cryostat-Controller

It should work with models 330, 336, 340. My gui is tested with 340 only, connected via GPIB. PyVisa is used for connection

You may extend the gui with other controls, here is the basic stuff I needed in my lab

Have fun ;))
