GUI for Lakeshore 330/336/340, live monitoring of current temperature, and set the setpoint temperature + control of Temperature ramp, heater range.

You are free to extend the gui with other controls, here is the basic stuff I needed in my lab.

It should work with models 330, 336, 340. My gui is tested with 340 only, connected via GPIB. PyVisa is used for connection.

Have fun ;))
